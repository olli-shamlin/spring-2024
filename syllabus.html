            <p>
                This course is designed to increase your digital proficiency specifically as it pertains to the
                Internet. Lectures presented over the course's sessions will give you a working understanding of
                how the Internet, the World Wide Web, and the Cloud work. While lectures will include technical
                discussions of how computers and software used with the Internet work, the lecture material targets
                a general audience. There is no prerequisite technical understanding needed for you to fully participate
                in this course.
            <p>
                Classroom exercises done with your laptop and a browser will reinforce the technical
                concepts presented in lectures. These exercises will give you exposure to the features and
                capabilities found in all browsers on the market today.

            <h3><em>What if I miss a session?</em></h3>
            <p>
                Each session's content builds on content from sessions that precede it.  If you miss a session, you
                will be able to find that session's material (e.g., lecture slides, exercises, and supplemental reading
                materials) on that session's detail page. You are encouraged to review the material and attempt
                the exercises for missed session(s) prior to the next session you attend.
        </div>
    <h2>Session Format</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                Sessions are two hours in length. There will be a ten-minute break near the middle of each session.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each session will be a combination of lecture + Q&A and hands-on exercises.  Some hands-on exercises
                will lead by the instructor with stepping through the activity at the same time; others will be
                written prompts that students will be given time in the classroom to attempt to complete independently.
                For the latter, the instructor will be available to assist students as needed.
            </p>
        </div>
    <h2>Required Materials</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                You will need a laptop that you can bring to each session to complete hands-on exercises.  You will
                also need
                <ul>
                    <li>Google Chrome browser installed on your laptop
                        <p>
                            If the Chrome browser is not already installed on your laptop, see the
                            <a href="resource_install_chrome.html">Installing Chrome</a> page on this site for
                            instructions on how to do so.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>A Google account
                        <p>
                            While you may already have a Google account (and you do if you use Gmail), you are strongly
                            encouraged to create a new Google account to use during the course.  Instructions on
                            creating and deleting a Google account can be found on the
                            <a href="resource_google_accounts.html">Creating and Deleting a Google Account</a> page
                            on this site.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3><em>Can I use my tablet or smartphone instead of a laptop?</em></h3>
                <p>
                    While Chrome can be used on smartphones and tablets in addition to laptops and computers,
                    using a smartphone or tablet instead of a laptop in this course is strong discouraged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The written material included with this course (slides, exercises, and additional references)
                    is based on the laptop/computer version of Chrome. While the Chrome features and capabilities
                    that will be discussed during the course are supported by the smartphone and tablet versions of
                    Chrome, how you access and use them on a smartphone or tablet differs (in some cases, significantly)
                    from laptop/computer version of Chrome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While you will not be excluded from the course if you chose to bring a tablet or smartphone to
                    sessions, you may experience challenges completing exercises due to the fact that course materials
                    present "how to" instructions and examples using the laptop/desktop version of Chrome. Expect
                    the instructor's capacity and ability to assist you in addressing differences between the
                    laptop/desktop and smartphone/tablet versions of Chrome to be limited.

    <h2>Policies and Conduct</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                While we will uphold <a href="https://learnmore.duke.edu/olli/policies">the policies of OLLI at Duke</a>
                practicing our community's values of Curiosity, Connection, Kindness, and Compassion; these sentences from
                our Code of Conduct appropriately reflect the attitude all participates are expected to have: <em>We welcome
                a lively and passionate exchange of ideas and perspectives. Opposing viewpoints are welcomed and
                appreciated.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Instructor and students need to foster a classroom atmosphere of trust and respect in order to maximize
                the value and benefit we receive during group discussions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, web-related technologies that we will survey during the course can be complex. While the
                instructor is committed to making lecture content suitable for a general audience regardless of computer
                and software proficiency, questions are not only expected, they are appreciated and valued. Carl Sagan
                may have said it best in his work <em>The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark</em>:
