        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>
            Do you wonder what the cloud really is and how it works? Do you get frustrated by the pop-up windows in
            your browser that ask if you are willing to accept cookies? Are you curious why some sites prompt you to
            provide both an email address and a phone number when you create an account? You are not alone. Everyone
            experiences challenges using the internet at some point. This course is designed to help you improve your
            digital life by giving you a deeper understanding of basic digital technology concepts. We will explore
            how the Internet and Cloud work through a series of lectures and instructor-led exercises using
            a browser. You will become more familiar with common browser features and learn how to better use them to
            your advantage. You will gain a clearer understanding of what happens when you log in to a site, and how
            using a password manager can make it easy to create and use strong passwords. This course will increase
            your confidence when surfing the internet.
